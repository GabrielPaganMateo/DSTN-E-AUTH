*(configure aws cli and aws ses in cdk
*Add email verification feature, use AWS SES (Email Service) https://hellokoding.com/email-verification-example-with-spring-boot-mysql-docker-compose/
as part of the process i am going to remove the usernme attribute and instead make the user use an email that must be verified, Right now I am at Create ServicesS
*Instead of using PostgreSQL and JPA repositories I want to use DynamoDB to store user object information and the verification tokens as well (I recently learned that
SQL databases are only ideal when the stored data must be analyzed across multiple tables but when only when one table is necessary amd no analysis of data is required
 then DynamoDB is a much better option
*Create BlogService (Actual service that I want to show users after logging in)
*Download and Use DBeaver instead of PGAdmin for DB management
